        <p class="lead">The crafts here are accessories with electronics enabled for Burning Man event of 2018. Most of the items I created are ran by some sort of Arduino iteration. And
            as always in the burn, I basically ended up giving most of them as presents. :)</p>        
        <p>The led themselves are Adafruit's neopixels, crazy bright, I had to dial them down so I won't blind people.</p>>
        <p>The NeoPixels LEDs have Integrated Drivers and their own micropython library, you can find my code online in my GitHub repositories.</p>
        <p>In comparison with computer software, the harder part with coding lightshow with electronics, is that you can easily burn them. 
            Driving the wrong value or connecting the wrong pin can has disastrous consequences. Debugging and trial and erroring was also very hard, 
            between your vision of how to express specific light show as code, to what actually happens and then fixing it was a long learning process.

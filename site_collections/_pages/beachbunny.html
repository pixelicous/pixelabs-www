        <p>In surfing there is a term called "Beach Bunny", I ain't wikipedia, look it up</p>
        <p>A good surfing buddy of mine and I had a joke about it, while after I noticed I have this bug bunny vinyl toy for DIY painting.</p>
        <p>So this is my take on a custom bugs bunny DIY vinyl model. The photos below describe the thought process and the outcome</p>
        <p>I took photos of the process but have them backed up some place, once I find them, it will be posted.</p>
        <h3 class="my-3">Other points</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Vinyl based</li>
          <li>Around 10 colors in the palette</li>
        </ul>

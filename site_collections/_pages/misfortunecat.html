  <div class="col-md-6">
      <h3 class="my-3 text-roboto-300 text-primary">DETAILS</h3>
      <p>I have received a blank black MisFortune Cat Vinyl figure.</p>
      <p>Sanded, primed than painted on.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately I didn't document the process at the time. I think the longest part was to achieve the rusty looking green/orange peeling look I was after.</p>
      <h3 class="my-3 text-roboto-300 text-primary">RANDOM FACTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>~ 40 layers on body to receive rust effect.</li>
        <li>Acrylic</li>
      </ul>
  </div>

        <p>In 2014 I visited Venice, Italy. I immediately took notice like any tourist at the masks they have.</p>
        <p>There is a big notion there to just custom the masks, make them steampunk etc, so I decided I'll do my own take on it</p>
        <p>I went into a few stores, bought all sorts of weird supplies and started sketching. I quickly decided to just go with the flow.</p>
        <p>Through the images below you can see the painting process, It involved a total of around 20 layers give or take.</p>
        <h3 class="my-3">Other points</h3>
